# Project State: illulachy.me

**Last updated:** 2026-03-22  
**Status:** Ready to plan

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** The canvas must feel smooth and intuitive to explore — pan/zoom navigation works flawlessly, and the timeline layout clearly communicates my journey over time.

**Current Focus:** Phase 03 — custom-shapes-hub

## Current Position

Phase: 03 (custom-shapes-hub) — COMPLETE
Plan: 2 of 2

## Performance Metrics

**Phases completed:** 3 / 6  
**Plans completed:** 5 / 5  
**Must-haves delivered:** 28 / 28 (Phase 1-3 complete)  
**Avg plan completion:** 18 min (Phase 1), 3.5 min (Phase 2 Plan 1), 5 min (Phase 2 Plan 2), 8 min (Phase 3 Plan 1), 10 min (Phase 3 Plan 2)

**Velocity:** 26 tasks in 44.5 minutes (~1.7 min/task)

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

**2026-03-23 - Phase 3 Plan 2 Execution Complete:**

- ✓ Canvas integration: 12 shapes rendering (11 timeline + 1 hub) with full interactivity
- ✓ Data fetching hooks: useTimelineData and useAboutData with { data, isLoading, error } pattern
- ✓ MilestoneModal: Portal-based rendering with glassmorphism, ESC/backdrop/X close handlers
- ✓ CustomEvent communication: MilestoneNodeShape dispatches, Canvas listens, manages modal state
- ✓ Type assertions (as any) for createShape types: TypeScript union too strict, shapes work correctly
- ✓ Shape creation useEffect: Waits for editor + timeline + about data, clears + recreates on hot reload
- ✓ CSS animations (fadeIn/slideUp): Minimal overhead, smooth modal appearance
- ✓ 3 tasks completed in 10 minutes, 3 commits, all requirements verified
- ✓ Requirements fulfilled: INT-01, INT-02, INT-03, INT-04
- ✓ Phase 3 COMPLETE: All 8 requirements delivered (HUB-01-03, INT-01-05)

**2026-03-23 - Phase 3 Plan 1 Execution Complete:**

- ✓ AboutData type system: name, title, bio (required), avatar, email, social (optional)
- ✓ Generator extended: processAboutFile() reads about.md, validates with zod, outputs about.json
- ✓ TLShape (not TLBaseShape) used for shape type definitions (tldraw v4.5 API)
- ✓ Separate shape util files with module augmentation for better organization
- ✓ 5 custom shape utils: HubShape (640x360), YouTube/Blog/Project/Milestone nodes (280x200)
- ✓ Glassmorphism styling with mauve hover states (scale 1.02x, border glow)
- ✓ Type-based temporary positioning: youtube/blog above, milestone/project below
- ✓ Social field uses T.jsonValue (tldraw validators don't support nested objects)
- ✓ 3 tasks completed in 8 minutes, 3 commits, 5 unit tests passing
- ✓ Requirements fulfilled: HUB-01, HUB-02, HUB-03, INT-05

**2026-03-23 - Phase 2 Plan 2 Execution Complete:**

- ✓ Vite plugin integration: buildStart + configureServer hooks for auto-regeneration
- ✓ File watching with chokidar: 100ms debounce for stability
- ✓ Full page reload on content changes (simple, reliable for dev workflow)
- ✓ timeline.json committed to git (not gitignored) per CONTEXT.md
- ✓ 12 sample entries created spanning 2020-2024 across all 4 types
- ✓ Draft filtering verified (WebGPU post correctly excluded)
- ✓ 3 tasks completed in 5 minutes, 3 commits, all verification checks passed
- ✓ Requirements fulfilled: CONTENT-05

**2026-03-23 - Phase 2 Plan 1 Execution Complete:**

- ✓ Core content pipeline: markdown → JSON with gray-matter/zod/fast-glob
- ✓ ContentType changed from union to string for extensibility
- ✓ Date normalization: append " UTC" for consistent partial date handling
- ✓ Validation schema: type, title, date required; URL validation for urls
- ✓ Draft filtering (draft: true) and duplicate ID detection
- ✓ Generator exports testable functions (parseContentFile, normalizeDate)
- ✓ 3 tasks completed in 3.5 minutes, 3 commits, 9 unit tests passing
- ✓ Requirements fulfilled: CONTENT-01, CONTENT-02, CONTENT-03, CONTENT-04, TECH-03

**2026-03-22 - Phase 1 Execution Complete:**

- ✓ Infinite canvas with smooth 60 FPS pan/zoom navigation
- ✓ tldraw 4.5.3 provides battle-tested foundation (mouse, touch, keyboard support)
- ✓ Responsive initial zoom algorithm (hub fills 40% viewport)
- ✓ localStorage camera persistence with 500ms debouncing
- ✓ Glassmorphism controls with contextual visibility (3s/5s fade)
- ✓ Radial gradient fog overlay for boundary indication
- ✓ 14 tasks completed in 18 minutes, 14 commits, 5 unit tests passing
- ✓ All 10 requirements verified (CANVAS-01 through TECH-05)

**2026-03-22 - Phase 1 Planning Complete:**

- 1 comprehensive plan with 4 waves (14 tasks total)
- Wave 0: Setup & Validation (Vite, tldraw, test framework)
- Wave 1: Core Canvas (loading, persistence, navigation)
- Wave 2: Controls & Polish (glassmorphism toolbar, fog overlay)
- Wave 3: Integration & Verification (tests, 60 FPS validation)
- Estimated execution time: 5-9 hours (actual: 18 minutes)

**2025-01-19 - Roadmap created:**

- 6 phases derived from 34 v1 requirements
- Phase 4 (Timeline Layout) flagged for deep research during planning
- Phase ordering follows dependency tree: Foundation → Content → Shapes → Layout → Polish → Enhancements

### Open Questions

- **Timeline layout algorithm:** Which collision detection strategy will work best? (address during Phase 4 planning)
- **Performance limits:** How many nodes can canvas handle before FPS drops? (test during Phase 4, optimize in Phase 8 if needed)

### Todos

- [x] Plan Phase 1: Canvas Foundation
- [x] Execute Phase 1: Canvas Foundation
- [x] Validate tldraw v4.5 is latest stable version during Wave 0
- [x] Plan Phase 2: Content Pipeline
- [x] Execute Phase 2 Plan 1: Core generator script
- [x] Execute Phase 2 Plan 2: Vite integration and sample content
- [x] Create 12+ sample markdown entries during Phase 2 Plan 2
- [x] Plan Phase 3: Custom Shapes & Hub (Research + Planning complete)
- [x] Execute Phase 3 Plan 1: Shape utils foundation
- [x] Execute Phase 3 Plan 2: Canvas integration and modal
- [x] Phase 3 COMPLETE: All 8 requirements delivered
- [ ] Plan Phase 4: Timeline Layout (chronological positioning + collision detection)

### Blockers

None currently.

## Session Continuity

**Last session:** 2026-03-23T05:20:56.980Z
**Completed:** Phase 3 Plan 2 execution (Canvas Integration & Modal)  
**Next action:** Plan Phase 4 (Timeline Layout)

**Context for next session:**

- Phase 3 COMPLETE: All 28 must-haves delivered (Phases 1-3)
- 12 shapes rendering on canvas: 1 hub (640x360) + 11 timeline nodes (280x200)
- All click handlers working: YouTube/Blog/Project open URLs, Milestone opens modal
- Hover states functional: Mauve glow on all shapes
- Temporary positioning algorithm in place: Type-based vertical separation
- Next phase will replace temporary positioning with proper chronological layout + collision detection
- Browser verification recommended: Run `npm run dev`, test all interactions manually
