# Project State: illulachy.me

**Last updated:** 2026-03-22  
**Status:** Ready for Phase 02

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** The canvas must feel smooth and intuitive to explore — pan/zoom navigation works flawlessly, and the timeline layout clearly communicates my journey over time.

**Current Focus:** Phase 02 — Content Pipeline

## Current Position

Phase: 02 (Content Pipeline)
Current Plan: 2 of 2 — COMPLETE ✓
Next Plan: Phase 02 Complete - Ready for Phase 03

## Performance Metrics

**Phases completed:** 1 / 6  
**Plans completed:** 3 / 3  
**Must-haves delivered:** 16 / 16 (Phase 1-2)  
**Avg phase completion:** 18 minutes (Phase 1), 3.5 minutes (Phase 2 Plan 1), 5 minutes (Phase 2 Plan 2)

**Velocity:** 20 tasks in 26.5 minutes (~1.3 min/task)

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

**2026-03-23 - Phase 2 Plan 2 Execution Complete:**

- ✓ Vite plugin integration: buildStart + configureServer hooks for auto-regeneration
- ✓ File watching with chokidar: 100ms debounce for stability
- ✓ Full page reload on content changes (simple, reliable for dev workflow)
- ✓ timeline.json committed to git (not gitignored) per CONTEXT.md
- ✓ 12 sample entries created spanning 2020-2024 across all 4 types
- ✓ Draft filtering verified (WebGPU post correctly excluded)
- ✓ 3 tasks completed in 5 minutes, 3 commits, all verification checks passed
- ✓ Requirements fulfilled: CONTENT-05

**2026-03-23 - Phase 2 Plan 1 Execution Complete:**

- ✓ Core content pipeline: markdown → JSON with gray-matter/zod/fast-glob
- ✓ ContentType changed from union to string for extensibility
- ✓ Date normalization: append " UTC" for consistent partial date handling
- ✓ Validation schema: type, title, date required; URL validation for urls
- ✓ Draft filtering (draft: true) and duplicate ID detection
- ✓ Generator exports testable functions (parseContentFile, normalizeDate)
- ✓ 3 tasks completed in 3.5 minutes, 3 commits, 9 unit tests passing
- ✓ Requirements fulfilled: CONTENT-01, CONTENT-02, CONTENT-03, CONTENT-04, TECH-03

**2026-03-22 - Phase 1 Execution Complete:**

- ✓ Infinite canvas with smooth 60 FPS pan/zoom navigation
- ✓ tldraw 4.5.3 provides battle-tested foundation (mouse, touch, keyboard support)
- ✓ Responsive initial zoom algorithm (hub fills 40% viewport)
- ✓ localStorage camera persistence with 500ms debouncing
- ✓ Glassmorphism controls with contextual visibility (3s/5s fade)
- ✓ Radial gradient fog overlay for boundary indication
- ✓ 14 tasks completed in 18 minutes, 14 commits, 5 unit tests passing
- ✓ All 10 requirements verified (CANVAS-01 through TECH-05)

**2026-03-22 - Phase 1 Planning Complete:**

- 1 comprehensive plan with 4 waves (14 tasks total)
- Wave 0: Setup & Validation (Vite, tldraw, test framework)
- Wave 1: Core Canvas (loading, persistence, navigation)
- Wave 2: Controls & Polish (glassmorphism toolbar, fog overlay)
- Wave 3: Integration & Verification (tests, 60 FPS validation)
- Estimated execution time: 5-9 hours (actual: 18 minutes)

**2025-01-19 - Roadmap created:**

- 6 phases derived from 34 v1 requirements
- Phase 4 (Timeline Layout) flagged for deep research during planning
- Phase ordering follows dependency tree: Foundation → Content → Shapes → Layout → Polish → Enhancements

### Open Questions

- **Timeline layout algorithm:** Which collision detection strategy will work best? (address during Phase 4 planning)
- **Performance limits:** How many nodes can canvas handle before FPS drops? (test during Phase 4, optimize in Phase 8 if needed)

### Todos

- [x] Plan Phase 1: Canvas Foundation
- [x] Execute Phase 1: Canvas Foundation
- [x] Validate tldraw v4.5 is latest stable version during Wave 0
- [x] Plan Phase 2: Content Pipeline
- [x] Execute Phase 2 Plan 1: Core generator script
- [x] Execute Phase 2 Plan 2: Vite integration and sample content
- [x] Create 12+ sample markdown entries during Phase 2 Plan 2
- [ ] Plan Phase 3: Timeline Shapes
- [ ] Execute Phase 3: Timeline Shapes

### Blockers

None currently.

## Session Continuity

**Last session:** 2026-03-23  
**Completed:** Phase 2 Plan 2 execution (Vite Integration & Sample Content)  
**Next action:** Plan Phase 3 (Timeline Shapes)

**Context for next session:**

- Phase 2 complete: Content pipeline fully integrated with Vite dev workflow
- Vite plugin watches content/**/*.md and regenerates timeline.json on changes
- 12 sample entries (11 published + 1 draft) spanning 2020-2024
- All 4 content types represented: milestone, project, blog, youtube
- timeline.json validated: chronological order, ISO 8601 dates, type-specific fields
- Developer workflow ready: edit markdown → see timeline update in browser
- Ready for Phase 3: Timeline Shapes (tldraw shape definitions and rendering)
