  2. User can zoom the canvas using scroll wheel without frame drops
  3. User can pan and zoom using touch gestures on mobile (drag, pinch-to-zoom)
  4. User can navigate using arrow keys to move viewport
  5. Canvas maintains 60 FPS during all interactions (measured with Chrome DevTools)

  2. Build process parses markdown files and outputs timeline.json with all entries
  3. At least 10-20 sample entries exist spanning multiple content types (YouTube, blog, project, milestone)
  4. Timeline JSON loads at runtime without parsing markdown
**Plans:** 2/2 complete

Plans:

**Requirements:** TIME-01, TIME-02, TIME-03, TIME-04, TIME-05, TIME-06, TIME-07
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Timeline extends left from portfolio node (horizontal axis represents time)
  2. Nodes are positioned chronologically with oldest entries farthest left
  3. Most recent entries appear closest to portfolio hub
  4. Nodes with same/close dates don't overlap (collision detection working)
