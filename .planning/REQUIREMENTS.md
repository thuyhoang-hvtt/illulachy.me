- **ENH-03**: Dark mode support
- **ENH-04**: Timeline mini-map for navigation

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| CMS or admin panel | Content managed via markdown in Git — simpler for single author |
| Embedded video playback | Increases bundle size, slower on mobile — link to YouTube instead |
| Real-time collaboration | No use case — single-author portfolio |
| Server-side rendering | Canvas is client-only, SSR adds complexity with no SEO benefit |
| Authentication | Public portfolio site, no login needed |
| Advanced analytics | Web Vitals sufficient for v1, defer heatmaps/session replay |
