# Requirements: illulachy.me

**Defined:** 2026-03-28
**Core Value:** The canvas must feel smooth and intuitive to explore — pan/zoom navigation works flawlessly, and the timeline layout clearly communicates my journey over time.

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Comments section | Requires backend/moderation; single-author blog doesn't need it — link to Twitter/X instead |
| CMS or admin panel | Git + markdown workflow works for developer author |
| Email newsletter | Requires email service + GDPR compliance; RSS covers subscribe use case |
| Server-side rendering | Static generation gives same SEO benefits with simpler hosting |
| Infinite scroll | Breaks browser history/back button; simple pagination or show all |
| Social sharing buttons | Large JS payload; OG tags make native sharing look great |
| View counters | Adds JS payload + external calls; use Vercel analytics if needed |
| Real-time collaboration | No use case — single-author portfolio |
| Embedded video playback | Link to YouTube instead — simpler |
| Authentication | Public site, no login needed |
